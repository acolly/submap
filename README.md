Submap: Subdomain Mapper
========================

What is it?
-----------

Submap is a small python script that attempts to resolve
a list of sub-domains against a given target using
'subs.txt' as a sub-domain source list. I would love to
see the results of you guys messing around with the code
so just hit me up with an email or pull request.

Features
--------

Submap is uses Python 2.7 and only uses builtin modules at
the moment. It takes the subdomains it needs to use from
'subs'.txt which contains a very extensive list, feel free
to add more to it.

The Latest Version
------------------

The latest version of submap can be found here. Check the
license file for more information.

Basic Usage
-----------

To use, simply ```cd``` to the directory with 'submap.py' 
and 'subs.txt'. Ensure that 'subs.txt' is there. Then do
```python submap.py [target]``` and replace ```[target]``` 
with the url you wish to scan. 

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is currently under development. When it is
finished it will most likely be located at the url given:
'colly.gitub.io/submap/doc'.

Installation
------------

There is no real installation as the only things you need
is Python 2.7, the script itself and 'subs.txt'. The first
can be downloaded here: 'https://www.python.org/downloads/'
while the rest can be downloaded from here.

Submap is licensed under the MIT license. See the license
