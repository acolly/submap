  What is it?
  -----------

  Submap is a small python script that attempts to resolve
  a list of sub-domains against a given target using
  'subs.txt' as a sub-domain source list. I would love to
  see the results of you guys messing around with the code
  so just hit me up with an email or pull request.

  Features
  --------

  Submap is uses Python 2.7 and only uses builtin modules at
  the moment. It takes the subdomains it needs to use from
  'subs'.txt which contains a very extensive list, feel free
  to add more to it.

  The latest version of submap can be found here.
